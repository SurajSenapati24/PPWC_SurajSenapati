q13). Trace the execution of the following fragment at line-1.
 int m = 10, n = 5;
 int *mp, *np;     
 mp = &m;
 np = &n;
 *mp = *mp + *np;
 *np = *mp- *np;
 printf("%d %d\n%d %d\n", m, *mp, n, *np); /*
 line-1 */

 Output Should be:
 15 15
 10 10

 q14)
 int m = 25, n = 77;
 char c = ’*’;
 int *itemp;
 /* describe the errors in each of the
 following statements. */
 m = &n;
 itemp = m;
 *itemp = c;
 *itemp = &c;

 Errors: 
 m = &n;
 m is int type and &n is address of n which should be stored in a pointer variable. Can't store address in integer variable
 itemp = m;
 itemp is a pointer variable, it can't store intger values .It can only contain address of a integer.
 *itemp = c;itemp is a pointer of integer type can't store char type data in it
 *itemp = &c;itemp is a pointer of integer type can store address of char in it
