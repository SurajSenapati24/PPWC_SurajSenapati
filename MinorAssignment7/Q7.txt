Write valid or invalid form of the followings.
 (1) union{....}u;
Valid
This is an anonymous union with a variable u.
The union is declared without a name but can still be accessed using u.

 (2) union u{......};
Valid
This declares a named union u but does not create a variable.
To use it, you must declare a variable later, like union u var;.

 (3) struct{.....}s;
Valid
This is an anonymous structure with a variable s.
Similar to anonymous unions, it defines a structure without giving it a type name.

 (4) struct s{.....};
Valid
This declares a named structure s but does not instantiate a variable.
A variable must be declared separately, like struct s var;.
