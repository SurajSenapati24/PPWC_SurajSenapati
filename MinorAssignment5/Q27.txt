Find out the correct syntal(s) for making a constant pointer (i.e. The value of the pointer is constant
and pointer cannot be modified).

(1) const <data_type> * ptr;
→The value pointed to by ptr is constant, but the pointer itself can be modified.
(2) <data_type> * const ptr;
→ The pointer ptr is constant, meaning it cannot point to another address, but the value at the address can be changed.
(3) <dat_type> const *ptr;
→Same as option 1; the value pointed to by ptr is constant, not the pointer.
(4) <data_type> const * const fun_ptr
→Both the pointer and the value it points to are constant.
(5) None of these

Answer: Option 2 is correct
